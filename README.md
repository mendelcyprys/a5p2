Python exercise for CONEL course

## Flask framework
Install requirements with `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` (idealy in a virtual Python environment.)

Run with the command `python -m flask run`

(This will create an empty database if none yet exist in the expected location.)

There are scripts to add sample data that can then be run.
